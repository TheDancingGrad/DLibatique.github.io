Communication as Power: The Correction of Sophocles’ Tereus in Aristophanes’ Birds	Talk	tereus-birds	CAAS	2017-10-07	New York, NY		This paper offers two related arguments. First, after analyzing the fragments of Sophocles’ Tereus, I argue that Sophocles empowers his female characters, Procne and Philomela, by giving them voices or abilities to communicate that transgress Greek societal norms, in which silence was the sine qua non of femininity. Most importantly, Procne’s speech (fr. 583 Radt, very recently expanded by the discovery of more lines published in P. Oxy. 5292 [see Finglass 2016 and Slattery 2016]) and the description of Philomela’s communication through weaving as “the voice of the shuttle” (fr. 595 Radt) assert the agency of both characters at moments when agency seems stolen from them. This reading will illuminate two previously unexamined areas, namely Sophocles’ dramaturgical choices about whom he allows to speak (if the theorized attributions of speech are sound) and the impact of those choices on gender, as relates to Procne as a vocal wife and mother and Philomela as a silenced rape victim, forced to communicate through letters woven into a tapestry. // Second, I examine Aristophanes’ Birds and posit that he attempts to correct the hierarchy of power constructed by Sophocles by empowering the male character, Tereus, with speech while muting Procne and in fact reducing her to the object of sexual advances by Euelpides and Peisetairos. This Aristophanic flip of the hierarchy puts on display a “normative” male-female relationship, with a vocal man and a silent woman, in a striking subversion of the wider conceit in the Aristophanic corpus of gender role reversal (as evidenced by, among others, the Kinsman in Thesmophoriazusae and the women in Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae). Perhaps the utopian nature of Nephelokokkygia requires the example of such a socio-cultural ideal.
Speech, Silence, and Artistic Expression in the Pervigilium Veneris	Talk	pervigilium	CAMWS	2017-04-07	Kitchener, ON, CA		In this paper, I investigate the narratorial intrusion at the end of the Pervigilium Veneris, an anonymous poem of 93 lines likely attributable to the 4th century C.E. (Mandolfo 2008, 28-29, among others), mostly a panegyric to Venus and the rebirth of spring until the narrator’s personal voice is expressed at line 89. A reference (86-88) to the sonorous swallow, the metamorphosed form of the Athenian princess Philomela, causes the narrator to lament that he has lost his own voice and that he longs to experience a rebirth and sing like the sparrow (89-92). After analyzing the verbs of speech or silence and their agents throughout the poem, I will argue that the author valorizes the swallow’s song precisely because he gives credence to the theme generated by the versions of the Philomela myth found in Sophocles’ Tereus, Aristophanes’ Birds, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses, namely that the ability to communicate is indicative of power, an agency that the poet has not exhibited for almost 90 lines of the poem. I will then provisionally suggest that the Pervigilium Veneris is stylistically and thematically indebted to imperial panegyric and this lament for a lost method of personal expression euphemizes a complaint about a lack of artistic inventiveness. // Twelve out of fifteen verbs of speech throughout the poem until line 86 take the powerful Venus as agent (dicit, 7; iussit, 22; iussit, 28; iussus est x2, 32; rogare, 40; iussit, 49; dicit, 50; iussit, 55; iussit, 56; iussit, 67; iussit, 84); the sheer frequency of forms of the verb iubere draw attention to Venus’ authority (Najock 1985, 198). Two other speech acts result from Venus’ direct order and augment the perception of her power: the nymphs ask Diana to leave the forest in direct speech: una res est quam rogamus, 38; and the chattery, raucous swans make their pools resound: iam loquaces ore rauco stagna cycni perstrepunt, 85. The last verb of speech is a sort of Alexandrian footnote that characterizes Venus’ son as country-born (dicitur, 77). In sum, those fifteen verbs appear in about 16.5% of the first 85 lines of the poem. Then, every line from 86 to 91 (the end of the poem) includes verbs of speech or silence; the former type take the swallow as agent (adsonat, 86; dici, 87; queri, 88; cantat, 89) while the latter take the poet or an analogue for the poet (tacemus, 89; tacere, 90; tacendo, 91; tacerent, 92). // In this concentration of words about sound versus silence, the narrator places himself in an abject position, inferior to the swallow, whose song indicates a freedom and renewal that the poet has not yet experienced: quando uer uenit meum? “When is my spring coming?” (89). In so doing, he empowers the swallow and reifies the perception of Philomela as a vocal agent in her own right. Simultaneously, he draws attention to his own inability to sing, a paradoxical assertion in light of the previous 89 lines of the poem. However, I suggest that he complains about his song’s content rather than singing itself. His poem’s panegyric for Venus evokes the style and content of the kind of imperial panegyric in vogue at the time of the poem’s composition, as evidenced in the XII Panegyrici Latini, a body of twelve speeches whose “content…is traditional to the point of being formulaic” (Nixon and Rogers 1994, 21). The narrator in the Pervigilium thus seems to long for a moment of poetic inventiveness that will stand out from the uninspired mass, a creation as inventive as that of Ovid’s or Sophocles’ version of the Philomela myth.
Pietas as Scelus in the Philomela Myth of Ovid’s Metamorphoses (6.424-674)	Talk	pietas-scelus	OSU Graduate Student Conference	2017-03-25	Columbus, OH		In the Philomela myth, which occupies the final third of Ovid’s Metamorphoses 6, the Athenian princess Procne decides to kill her child, Itys, in retaliation against her husband Tereus, king of Thrace, who raped and mutilated her sister Philomela. Her justification equates familial dutifulness with a crime: scelus est pietas in coniuge Terei, “dutifulness is an evil in the wife of Tereus” (635). The copulative equation of scelus and pietas encapsulates the problematization of the latter: pietas demands dutifulness to one’s family, but Procne’s pietas is torn between her married family (Itys) and her natal family (Philomela), the latter of which wins out. Necessarily, pietas towards one functions as scelus towards the other. // In this paper, I examine the uses of the noun pietas and adjective pius, -a, -um within the Philomela narrative and argue that the vilification of pietas functions not only as a narrative theme but also as an illustration of Ovid’s tumultuous engagement with Augustan ideology, a pillar of which was the salubrity of the familial unit. The equation of scelus and pietas does not entirely oppose Augustanism but rather draws attention to the slipperiness of its definitions; one’s dutifulness is another’s wickedness, and vice versa.
Facundum faciebat amor: The Absence of Tereus’ Direct Speech in Ovid’s Metamorphoses 6	Talk	facundum-faciebat-amor	CANE	2017-03-17	Exeter, NH		In this paper, I examine Ovid’s Philomela narrative (Met. 6.424-674) and analyze one of its narratological features overlooked in major scholarship on the episode (e.g., Peek 2003, Segal 1992, Gildenhard and Zissos 2007, Feldherr 2008): the surprising absence of direct speech attributed to Tereus, the Thracian king who married the Athenian princess Procne and raped and mutilated her sister Philomela. The narrator draws attention to this lack of a direct voice through numerous references to Tereus’ vocality and eloquence throughout the narrative (e.g., facundum faciebat amor, “Love made him eloquent,” 469). While he acts as the agent of nineteen verbs or phrases of speech which take direct objects, introduce indirect speech or questions, or serve as speech acts (compared to Philomela’s three or Procne’s eight), he speaks directly only twice (513, 652) and each time for less than one line of hexameter. This absence of a voice stands in stark contrast to the impassioned monologue of Philomela (533-548) and soliloquy of Procne (611-635). His relative silence is further brought into relief by the overt presence of the narrator, who amplifies his control over Tereus’ characterization through detailed description of his thought processes and dreams and constant parenthetical comments and direct addresses to the audience. // I argue that the poet’s overt manipulation of the direct speech (or lack thereof) of the characters in this narrative may illustrate his artistic anxiety over a new environment of poetic production under the burgeoning principate. Poets in this era are becoming increasingly aware of the disparity of power between the princeps and the other Roman nobles, one in which speech and artistic production are increasingly important tools used to craft or combat an ideology, to grant or withhold agency. In the face of increasing constraint, Ovid uses his portrayal of Tereus and Philomela in particular to assert his own agency; he draws attention to his careful control over Tereus’ speech and characterization, and he depicts Philomela as an analogue to himself through her ability to communicate through art despite the efforts of a tyrant to silence her.
