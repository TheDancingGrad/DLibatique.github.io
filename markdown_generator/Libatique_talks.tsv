Communication as Power: The Correction of Sophocles’ Tereus in Aristophanes’ Birds	Talk	tereus-birds	CAAS	2017-10-07	New York, NY		This paper offers two related arguments. First, after analyzing the fragments of Sophocles’ Tereus, I argue that Sophocles empowers his female characters, Procne and Philomela, by giving them voices or abilities to communicate that transgress Greek societal norms, in which silence was the sine qua non of femininity. Most importantly, Procne’s speech (fr. 583 Radt, very recently expanded by the discovery of more lines published in P. Oxy. 5292 [see Finglass 2016 and Slattery 2016]) and the description of Philomela’s communication through weaving as “the voice of the shuttle” (fr. 595 Radt) assert the agency of both characters at moments when agency seems stolen from them. This reading will illuminate two previously unexamined areas, namely Sophocles’ dramaturgical choices about whom he allows to speak (if the theorized attributions of speech are sound) and the impact of those choices on gender, as relates to Procne as a vocal wife and mother and Philomela as a silenced rape victim, forced to communicate through letters woven into a tapestry. // Second, I examine Aristophanes’ Birds and posit that he attempts to correct the hierarchy of power constructed by Sophocles by empowering the male character, Tereus, with speech while muting Procne and in fact reducing her to the object of sexual advances by Euelpides and Peisetairos. This Aristophanic flip of the hierarchy puts on display a “normative” male-female relationship, with a vocal man and a silent woman, in a striking subversion of the wider conceit in the Aristophanic corpus of gender role reversal (as evidenced by, among others, the Kinsman in Thesmophoriazusae and the women in Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae). Perhaps the utopian nature of Nephelokokkygia requires the example of such a socio-cultural ideal.
Speech, Silence, and Artistic Expression in the Pervigilium Veneris	Talk	pervigilium	CAMWS	2017-04-07	Kitchener, ON, CA		In this paper, I investigate the narratorial intrusion at the end of the Pervigilium Veneris, an anonymous poem of 93 lines likely attributable to the 4th century C.E. (Mandolfo 2008, 28-29, among others), mostly a panegyric to Venus and the rebirth of spring until the narrator’s personal voice is expressed at line 89. A reference (86-88) to the sonorous swallow, the metamorphosed form of the Athenian princess Philomela, causes the narrator to lament that he has lost his own voice and that he longs to experience a rebirth and sing like the sparrow (89-92). After analyzing the verbs of speech or silence and their agents throughout the poem, I will argue that the author valorizes the swallow’s song precisely because he gives credence to the theme generated by the versions of the Philomela myth found in Sophocles’ Tereus, Aristophanes’ Birds, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses, namely that the ability to communicate is indicative of power, an agency that the poet has not exhibited for almost 90 lines of the poem. I will then provisionally suggest that the Pervigilium Veneris is stylistically and thematically indebted to imperial panegyric and this lament for a lost method of personal expression euphemizes a complaint about a lack of artistic inventiveness. // Twelve out of fifteen verbs of speech throughout the poem until line 86 take the powerful Venus as agent (dicit, 7; iussit, 22; iussit, 28; iussus est x2, 32; rogare, 40; iussit, 49; dicit, 50; iussit, 55; iussit, 56; iussit, 67; iussit, 84); the sheer frequency of forms of the verb iubere draw attention to Venus’ authority (Najock 1985, 198). Two other speech acts result from Venus’ direct order and augment the perception of her power: the nymphs ask Diana to leave the forest in direct speech: una res est quam rogamus, 38; and the chattery, raucous swans make their pools resound: iam loquaces ore rauco stagna cycni perstrepunt, 85. The last verb of speech is a sort of Alexandrian footnote that characterizes Venus’ son as country-born (dicitur, 77). In sum, those fifteen verbs appear in about 16.5% of the first 85 lines of the poem. Then, every line from 86 to 91 (the end of the poem) includes verbs of speech or silence; the former type take the swallow as agent (adsonat, 86; dici, 87; queri, 88; cantat, 89) while the latter take the poet or an analogue for the poet (tacemus, 89; tacere, 90; tacendo, 91; tacerent, 92). // In this concentration of words about sound versus silence, the narrator places himself in an abject position, inferior to the swallow, whose song indicates a freedom and renewal that the poet has not yet experienced: quando uer uenit meum? “When is my spring coming?” (89). In so doing, he empowers the swallow and reifies the perception of Philomela as a vocal agent in her own right. Simultaneously, he draws attention to his own inability to sing, a paradoxical assertion in light of the previous 89 lines of the poem. However, I suggest that he complains about his song’s content rather than singing itself. His poem’s panegyric for Venus evokes the style and content of the kind of imperial panegyric in vogue at the time of the poem’s composition, as evidenced in the XII Panegyrici Latini, a body of twelve speeches whose “content…is traditional to the point of being formulaic” (Nixon and Rogers 1994, 21). The narrator in the Pervigilium thus seems to long for a moment of poetic inventiveness that will stand out from the uninspired mass, a creation as inventive as that of Ovid’s or Sophocles’ version of the Philomela myth.
Pietas as Scelus in the Philomela Myth of Ovid’s Metamorphoses (6.424-674)	Talk	pietas-scelus	OSU Graduate Student Conference	2017-03-25	Columbus, OH		In the Philomela myth, which occupies the final third of Ovid’s Metamorphoses 6, the Athenian princess Procne decides to kill her child, Itys, in retaliation against her husband Tereus, king of Thrace, who raped and mutilated her sister Philomela. Her justification equates familial dutifulness with a crime: scelus est pietas in coniuge Terei, “dutifulness is an evil in the wife of Tereus” (635). The copulative equation of scelus and pietas encapsulates the problematization of the latter: pietas demands dutifulness to one’s family, but Procne’s pietas is torn between her married family (Itys) and her natal family (Philomela), the latter of which wins out. Necessarily, pietas towards one functions as scelus towards the other. // In this paper, I examine the uses of the noun pietas and adjective pius, -a, -um within the Philomela narrative and argue that the vilification of pietas functions not only as a narrative theme but also as an illustration of Ovid’s tumultuous engagement with Augustan ideology, a pillar of which was the salubrity of the familial unit. The equation of scelus and pietas does not entirely oppose Augustanism but rather draws attention to the slipperiness of its definitions; one’s dutifulness is another’s wickedness, and vice versa.
Facundum faciebat amor: The Absence of Tereus’ Direct Speech in Ovid’s Metamorphoses 6	Talk	facundum-faciebat-amor	CANE	2017-03-17	Exeter, NH		In this paper, I examine Ovid’s Philomela narrative (Met. 6.424-674) and analyze one of its narratological features overlooked in major scholarship on the episode (e.g., Peek 2003, Segal 1992, Gildenhard and Zissos 2007, Feldherr 2008): the surprising absence of direct speech attributed to Tereus, the Thracian king who married the Athenian princess Procne and raped and mutilated her sister Philomela. The narrator draws attention to this lack of a direct voice through numerous references to Tereus’ vocality and eloquence throughout the narrative (e.g., facundum faciebat amor, “Love made him eloquent,” 469). While he acts as the agent of nineteen verbs or phrases of speech which take direct objects, introduce indirect speech or questions, or serve as speech acts (compared to Philomela’s three or Procne’s eight), he speaks directly only twice (513, 652) and each time for less than one line of hexameter. This absence of a voice stands in stark contrast to the impassioned monologue of Philomela (533-548) and soliloquy of Procne (611-635). His relative silence is further brought into relief by the overt presence of the narrator, who amplifies his control over Tereus’ characterization through detailed description of his thought processes and dreams and constant parenthetical comments and direct addresses to the audience. // I argue that the poet’s overt manipulation of the direct speech (or lack thereof) of the characters in this narrative may illustrate his artistic anxiety over a new environment of poetic production under the burgeoning principate. Poets in this era are becoming increasingly aware of the disparity of power between the princeps and the other Roman nobles, one in which speech and artistic production are increasingly important tools used to craft or combat an ideology, to grant or withhold agency. In the face of increasing constraint, Ovid uses his portrayal of Tereus and Philomela in particular to assert his own agency; he draws attention to his careful control over Tereus’ speech and characterization, and he depicts Philomela as an analogue to himself through her ability to communicate through art despite the efforts of a tyrant to silence her.
Borrowings and Code-Switches in the Passio Sanctarum Perpetuae et Felicitatis	Talk	passio	CAMWS	2016-03-18	Williamsburg, VA		In this paper, I focus on a key aspect of the diction of the Passio Sanctarum Perpetuae et Felicitatis, a martyr text in which a male Christian author (the so-called redactor, about whose identity and biography much has been postulated [Heffernan 2012:15-17]) purports to report the final thoughts and words of Saint Perpetua, condemned to die for her belief in Christianity around 200 CE. In particular, the Greek borrowings and code-switches (my definitions of which are based on Adams 2003:18-29) scattered throughout the text help reveal the anxiety of the male, upper-class redactor about the reality of Perpetua’s low social status. // First, I investigate the borrowings and code-switches primarily within Perpetua’s narrative in propria voce (chapters 3-10). I explore why the author used the particular terms that s/he does and probe the use of code-switching or borrowing in straightforward narrative versus the descriptions of her dreams. Then, I expand on that analysis to offer inferences about the historical Perpetua and the authorship of the Perpetua section. The redactor describes Perpetua as “born nobly, educated in the liberal arts, wedded as a matron” (honeste nata, liberaliter instituta, matronaliter nupta, 2.1) and the narrative as “written in her own hand and by her own sense” (conscriptum manu sua et suo sensu, 2.1), but the narrative details, borrowings, and code-switches undermine that assertion. // In short, the redactor’s description of Perpetua and this text belies an anxiety about the use of a lower-class, unwed mother as an exemplum of Christian martyrdom (for Perpetua’s low status, see Cooper 2013). His sanitization of Perpetua’s image manifests in the portrayal of details of Perpetua’s life incongruous with social reality and in the use of choice borrowings and code-switches. Perpetua may have been a historical figure, martyred around 200 CE, but this account of her final days has been filtered irreparably through the lens of male, upper-class anxiety.
Tragic Epistolography and the Molding of Myth in Ovid's Tristia 4.4	Talk	tristia	CAAS	2015-10-09	Wilmington, DE		In this paper, I investigate Ovid’s Tristia 4.4 and illustrate how Ovid refashions the mythic, tragic tradition of Orestes and Iphigenia (especially as portrayed in Euripides’ Iphigenia among the Taurians) to suit his own rhetorical needs. He creates a fiction into which his addressee Messalinus must buy so that he will do what Ovid wants him to do, namely intercede with the emperor for Ovid’s relocation to a better place or a full recall from exile. In order to convince Messalinus to help him, Ovid translates and transforms elements of the myth from the theatre to his letters: bloodthirsty, inhospitable Tauris becomes Tomis, despite the geographical distance between the two; the goddess Athena, beneficent in her rescue of Iphigenia and Orestes, becomes an exemplar for the way in which Ovid hopes the divine Augustus will act; details about the myth that do not directly support the parallel that Ovid draws (especially the recognition between brother and sister, the details of their escape, and the deception of Thoas) are diminished in importance or downright elided. While Ovid’s death in exile testifies to a lack of efficacy, whether in Ovid’s appeal to Messalinus or in Messalinus’ appeal to Augustus (if he was convinced by Ovid’s letter), the poem remains a testament to Ovid’s masterful manipulation of tradition and genre and illustrates what can happen when the author becomes the subject of his own poetry.
Cremutius Cordus and the Loss of Agency: Tacitus’ Annals 4.34-35	Talk	cremutius-cordus	CANE	2015-03-13	Dedham, MA		The speech of Cremutius Cordus at Tacitus Annals 4.34-35 has been analyzed variously for its careful placement in the narrative and analogical similarities to Tacitus’ contemporary environment. Situated carefully after a proemio al mezzo (4.32-33) wherein Tacitus espouses the utility, if not pleasure, of recounting and memorializing current events, the passage puts on display an exemplum of resistance to tyrannical power that resonates not only among Cremutius’ contemporaries but also among Tacitus and his. The content of the speech, however, belies the damage already done to proper expression of resistance, defined here as an active subversion of the strictures of (unjust) power. // In this paper, I focus closely on the careful syntax with which Cremutius Cordus' defense is introduced and expressed, namely the verbs. The attribution of agency, whether the verb itself is active, impersonal, or passive, rests mainly in entities other than Cremutius: his accusers; such authors as Livy and Messala Corvinus; the writings, speeches, and harangues of Asinius Pollio, Cicero, Caesar, Antony, Brutus, Furius Bibaculus, and Catullus. The sole instances of declarative speech-acts with Cremutius as subject are equivocation (haud facile dixerim, 4.34), praeteritio (non attingo Graecos, 4.35), or a leading question with a negative answer (num … populum per contiones incendo? 4.35). The syntax of the speech reveals that in the general milieu of the imperious princeps who exercises his immense power over literature and the elite, agency has already been irrevocably wrested even from such a lauded exemplum of resistance as Cremutius, at least in verbal speech. As such, agency must be transferred into literature and records of the past, the monuments that can carry the author’s power into posterity: quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet qui praesenti potentia credunt extingui posse etiam sequentis aevi memoriam (4.35).
The Königsrede as Temporal Microcosm: Sophocles’ Oedipus Tyrannos 216-275	Talk	konigsrede	CAMWS-SS	2014-10-16	Fredericksburg, VA		In Sophocles’ Oedipus Tyrannus, the flow of time begins in the present of the plague that besieges Thebes; then, the focus shifts to the past as questions about Oedipus’ parentage and Laius’ murder come to the fore; finally, the play ends in the future after Jocasta’s suicide and Oedipus’ blinding as Creon ascends to the throne and the fates of Oedipus and his girls are discussed. What has gone unnoticed, however, is a foreshadowing of this larger temporal structure of the play concentrated in a microcosm of sorts towards the beginning, in Oedipus’ Königsrede, or “King’s Speech,” of 216-275. Thus, this paper offers a new reading of the Königsrede through an investigation of its temporal flow. If my new analysis of the speech is accepted, it has important ramifications for the ordering of the text in modern editions; this reading makes a case for the presentation of the text in Hugh Lloyd-Jones and Nigel Wilson’s 1990 Oxford Classical Text and against the transpositions of Roger Dawe as implemented most recently in his 2006 ‘Green and Yellow’ Cambridge commentary and as will most likely appear in a future Teubner edition. If this temporal flow exists and charts the course of action for the rest of the tragedy, such transpositions as Dawe’s break up the flow and unnecessarily damage the correspondence between speech and play.
From Lead Role to Stage Body: The Disappearance of Tecmessa in Sophocles’ Ajax	Talk	tecmessa	CUNY Comparative Literature Graduate Conference	2013-11-07	New York, NY		In Sophocles' Ajax, the character Tecmessa undergoes a marked shift from Ajax's passionate concubine to a mute stage body in the second half of the play. In this paper, I investigate the impact of Tecmessa's maintenance of a somatic presence on stage but near effacement in the dramaturgical structure of the plot after Ajax’s death. She initially provides the main obstacle to Ajax’s will to die, delivering powerful monologues to deter him from committing suicide, and as a result, she is at once eloquent, rational, and sympathetic to the audience. Tecmessa’s voice disappears, however, upon Teucer’s entrance after the discovery of Ajax’s suicide. Indeed, after Teucer orders her to retrieve her son Eurysaces, she leaves the stage and returns as a mute, never to speak again, little more than a body in the stage picture. // I argue that this shift is a deliberate choice on Sophocles’ part to highlight the effects of a world post-Ajax. The first half of the play is filled with dynamic action, metrically-complex choral odes, and powerful diction, due in large part to the repartee between Ajax and Tecmessa. Ajax’s suicide marks the halfway point, and the second half by comparison settles into what some have considered a bland, uneventful extended debate. Tecmessa is a remnant of Ajax’s world of activity, a woman now forced to live in a world where speech reigns supreme. Her somatic presence in this second half of the play, coupled with the disappearance of a speaking voice or any plot-driving action, creates a liminality that comments on the passing of the heroic, active age of Ajax.
Rumor, Speech, and the Fall of a Homeric Age in Sophocles’ Ajax	Talk	ajax	University of Florida Graduate Conference	2013-10-26	Gainesville, FL		In this paper, I investigate the coincidence of the fall of the Homeric age of heroic deeds and the rise of an age where words and persuasion hold more sway. In Sophocles’ Ajax, the report of the eponymous protagonist's foiled plot to murder the Greek army and its commanders forces him to preclude suffering through the inevitable ignominy by committing suicide. That threat lay concentrated in the capacity of speech and rumor to destroy a reputation, but the potency of speech carries even stronger ramifications for the world of the play. // Ajax, Tecmessa, Teucer, and Odysseus each demonstrate the different effects of speech and its use. Ajax laments speech’s power to undermine his deeds. Tecmessa’s voice, so powerful in the first half of the play, is wrested away after Ajax kills himself and she becomes a mute character. Teucer finds himself at an impasse with the Atreidae when his speech cannot change their minds. Odysseus, however, breaks through the impasse and achieves Ajax’s burial with the very speech-related qualities that Ajax and the Chorus denigrate in the first half of the play. The journey of speech from source of censure to privileged mode of effecting action mirrors a sea change from a wartime world of the individual and aristeia through deeds to a peacetime world of the community and aristeia through words.
A Narratological Investigation of Ovid's Medea: Met. 7.1-424	Talk	narratological	Pacific Rim Roman Literature Seminar	2013-07-10	New York, NY		The Medea in Book 7 of Ovid’s Metamorphoses undergoes three different journeys: physical, thematic, and narratological. The stages of each of the former two can be constructed with ease from the text, but such an approach leaves unexplained and jarring the sharp delineations between the spatial and thematic settings. In this paper, in order to alleviate these breaks in unity, I apply the methodology of narratological focalization, as explained and utilized by Peek, to discern a structure to the Medea episode that runs parallel to the spatial and thematic structure and helps smooth the transitions between its different stages. By investigating the perspective from which the story is being told at any given time, we find that the poet utilizes the narrator and the god Liber as focalizers in order to rob Medea of any affective resonance and to prepare the audience for the brutality of her murder of Pelias respectively. These shifts in perspective and narratological cutaways allow Medea to complete her journey from innocent young girl to wicked sorceress more smoothly and signpost the stages of her evolution in a way that strictly spatial or thematic boundaries cannot mark.
