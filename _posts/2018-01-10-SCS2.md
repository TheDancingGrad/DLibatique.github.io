Here's part 2 of my SCS blog! I posted Part 1, on the OGL Workshop at Tufts, [here](https://dlibatique.github.io/posts/2018/01/scs1), so feel free to read through that if you haven't yet had a chance. In this portion, I'll talk about the Thursday evening and the Friday paper sessions.

### Thursday, 1/4 - Python Meet Up and the Opening Reception

Thursday began with a very informal meet up of digitally-inclined Classicists and archaeologists who use the coding language Python in their work, organized (or, well, super relaxedly convened via Twitter?) by Pat Burns ([@diyclassics](https://twitter.com/diyclassics)). There were about seven of us in all, including James Tauber and Helma Dik of Logeion / Attikos, and the conversation was lively! There are some plans hopefully coming to fruition soon that I don't want to scoop, but it suffices to say that there are some exciting Python-related things in the works for Classicists/archaeologists.

The theme of the day seemed to be personal connections. Afterward, I very briefly attended a post-OGL Workshop happy hour / dinner at Earle's in the Prudential Center and chatted with James a little further about his company, Eldarion, and how he came to be involved in the Perseus Project. After I left there, I had some time to kill, so I ended up sitting and chatting with Alexis Whalen ([@donumexitiale](https://twitter.com/donumexitiale)), who I had met earlier in the day and is friends with one of my BU colleagues, Ian Nurmi, about grad life, her teaching job in LA, and my dissertation topic. I didn't put two and two together until Ian and I were talking about how much I loved the [Itinera](http://itinerapodcast.libsyn.com) podcast by Scott Lepisto ([@scottlepisto](https://twitter.com/scottlepisto)) and he helped me realize that Alexis was the second interviewee featured! In the podcast, I appreciated her take on the use of spoken, living Latin in the classroom, so it was great to actually have some time to sit and chat with her face to face. She also had some wonderfully insightful observations about the *Pervigilium Veneris*, which forms the subject of the fourth chapter of my dissertation and has been giving me some writing problems recently, so a fresh take from a pair of unfamiliar eyes was very much needed and appreciated.

We continued to hang out into the opening reception, where we met up eventually with my BU colleagues. There was wine, there was food, there was friends -- we all had a great time.

### Friday, 1/5 - Agency in Drama, Harassment in Academia, Material Girls, Presidential Panel and Plenary Session

#### #Session9 - Agency in Drama (Helene Foley presiding)

This panel had the unenviable position of being in the first slot on Friday after a day or two of insane travel delays or outright cancellations.
