In this paper, I investigate Ovid’s Tristia 4.4 and illustrate how Ovid refashions the mythic, tragic tradition of Orestes and Iphigenia (especially as portrayed in Euripides’ Iphigenia among the Taurians) to suit his own rhetorical needs. He creates a fiction into which his addressee Messalinus must buy so that he will do what Ovid wants him to do, namely intercede with the emperor for Ovid’s relocation to a better place or a full recall from exile. In order to convince Messalinus to help him, Ovid translates and transforms elements of the myth from the theatre to his letters: bloodthirsty, inhospitable Tauris becomes Tomis, despite the geographical distance between the two; the goddess Athena, beneficent in her rescue of Iphigenia and Orestes, becomes an exemplar for the way in which Ovid hopes the divine Augustus will act; details about the myth that do not directly support the parallel that Ovid draws (especially the recognition between brother and sister, the details of their escape, and the deception of Thoas) are diminished in importance or downright elided. While Ovid’s death in exile testifies to a lack of efficacy, whether in Ovid’s appeal to Messalinus or in Messalinus’ appeal to Augustus (if he was convinced by Ovid’s letter), the poem remains a testament to Ovid’s masterful manipulation of tradition and genre and illustrates what can happen when the author becomes the subject of his own poetry.
