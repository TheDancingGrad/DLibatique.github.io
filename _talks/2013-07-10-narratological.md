The Medea in Book 7 of Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses undergoes three different journeys: physical, thematic, and narratological. The stages of each of the former two can be constructed with ease from the text, but such an approach leaves unexplained and jarring the sharp delineations between the spatial and thematic settings. In this paper, in order to alleviate these breaks in unity, I apply the methodology of narratological focalization, as explained and utilized by Peek, to discern a structure to the Medea episode that runs parallel to the spatial and thematic structure and helps smooth the transitions between its different stages. By investigating the perspective from which the story is being told at any given time, we find that the poet utilizes the narrator and the god Liber as focalizers in order to rob Medea of any affective resonance and to prepare the audience for the brutality of her murder of Pelias respectively. These shifts in perspective and narratological cutaways allow Medea to complete her journey from innocent young girl to wicked sorceress more smoothly and signpost the stages of her evolution in a way that strictly spatial or thematic boundaries cannot mark.
