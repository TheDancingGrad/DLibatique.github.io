In Sophocles’ Oedipus Tyrannus, the flow of time begins in the present of the plague that besieges Thebes; then, the focus shifts to the past as questions about Oedipus’ parentage and Laius’ murder come to the fore; finally, the play ends in the future after Jocasta’s suicide and Oedipus’ blinding as Creon ascends to the throne and the fates of Oedipus and his girls are discussed. What has gone unnoticed, however, is a foreshadowing of this larger temporal structure of the play concentrated in a microcosm of sorts towards the beginning, in Oedipus’ Königsrede, or “King’s Speech,” of 216-275. Thus, this paper offers a new reading of the Königsrede through an investigation of its temporal flow. If my new analysis of the speech is accepted, it has important ramifications for the ordering of the text in modern editions; this reading makes a case for the presentation of the text in Hugh Lloyd-Jones and Nigel Wilson’s 1990 Oxford Classical Text and against the transpositions of Roger Dawe as implemented most recently in his 2006 ‘Green and Yellow’ Cambridge commentary and as will most likely appear in a future Teubner edition. If this temporal flow exists and charts the course of action for the rest of the tragedy, such transpositions as Dawe’s break up the flow and unnecessarily damage the correspondence between speech and play.
