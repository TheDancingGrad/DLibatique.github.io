The speech of Cremutius Cordus at Tacitus Annals 4.34-35 has been analyzed variously for its careful placement in the narrative and analogical similarities to Tacitus’ contemporary environment. Situated carefully after a proemio al mezzo (4.32-33) wherein Tacitus espouses the utility, if not pleasure, of recounting and memorializing current events, the passage puts on display an exemplum of resistance to tyrannical power that resonates not only among Cremutius’ contemporaries but also among Tacitus and his. The content of the speech, however, belies the damage already done to proper expression of resistance, defined here as an active subversion of the strictures of (unjust) power. // In this paper, I focus closely on the careful syntax with which Cremutius Cordus&apos; defense is introduced and expressed, namely the verbs. The attribution of agency, whether the verb itself is active, impersonal, or passive, rests mainly in entities other than Cremutius: his accusers; such authors as Livy and Messala Corvinus; the writings, speeches, and harangues of Asinius Pollio, Cicero, Caesar, Antony, Brutus, Furius Bibaculus, and Catullus. The sole instances of declarative speech-acts with Cremutius as subject are equivocation (haud facile dixerim, 4.34), praeteritio (non attingo Graecos, 4.35), or a leading question with a negative answer (num … populum per contiones incendo? 4.35). The syntax of the speech reveals that in the general milieu of the imperious princeps who exercises his immense power over literature and the elite, agency has already been irrevocably wrested even from such a lauded exemplum of resistance as Cremutius, at least in verbal speech. As such, agency must be transferred into literature and records of the past, the monuments that can carry the author’s power into posterity: quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet qui praesenti potentia credunt extingui posse etiam sequentis aevi memoriam (4.35).
