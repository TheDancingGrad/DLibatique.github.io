In the Philomela myth, which occupies the final third of Ovid’s Metamorphoses 6, the Athenian princess Procne decides to kill her child, Itys, in retaliation against her husband Tereus, king of Thrace, who raped and mutilated her sister Philomela. Her justification equates familial dutifulness with a crime: scelus est pietas in coniuge Terei, “dutifulness is an evil in the wife of Tereus” (635). The copulative equation of scelus and pietas encapsulates the problematization of the latter: pietas demands dutifulness to one’s family, but Procne’s pietas is torn between her married family (Itys) and her natal family (Philomela), the latter of which wins out. Necessarily, pietas towards one functions as scelus towards the other. // In this paper, I examine the uses of the noun pietas and adjective pius, -a, -um within the Philomela narrative and argue that the vilification of pietas functions not only as a narrative theme but also as an illustration of Ovid’s tumultuous engagement with Augustan ideology, a pillar of which was the salubrity of the familial unit. The equation of scelus and pietas does not entirely oppose Augustanism but rather draws attention to the slipperiness of its definitions; one’s dutifulness is another’s wickedness, and vice versa.
