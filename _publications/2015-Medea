In this paper, I apply the methodology of narratolog- ical focalization to Ovid’s account of Medea in the Metamorpho- ses (7.1–424), an episode that many scholars have acknowledged as marked by jarring shifts. Focalization allows the reader to trace more subtly and appreciate more fully the step-by-step progression in Medea’s character, as the audience’s sympathy is gradually alien- ated from the young girl in love by means of shifting focalizations. I also investigate the neglected Liber vignette (7.294–296) as an important signpost for the murder of Pelias, rather than a retrospec- tive close to the Aeson episode.
