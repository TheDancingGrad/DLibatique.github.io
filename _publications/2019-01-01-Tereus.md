excerpt: 'In this paper, I suggest based on the discovery of a new Shepherd character in Sophocles' *Tereus* via *P.Oxy.* 5292 that the speaker of fr. 588 Radt is Procne, addressing the Shepherd and encouraging him to speak the truth in his report. Second, I attempt to contextualize P.J. Finglass’ placement of fr. 583 in the first episode of the play and respond to the ‘internment’ problem posited by David Fitzpatrick by suggesting that the play takes place on an anniversary or some sort of commemoration of Philomela’s supposed death.'

In this paper, I suggest based on the discovery of a new Shepherd character in Sophocles' *Tereus* via *P.Oxy.* 5292 that the speaker of fr. 588 Radt is Procne, addressing the Shepherd and encouraging him to speak the truth in his report. Second, I attempt to contextualize P.J. Finglass’ placement of fr. 583 in the first episode of the play and respond to the ‘internment’ problem posited by David Fitzpatrick by suggesting that the play takes place on an anniversary or some sort of commemoration of Philomela’s supposed death.
